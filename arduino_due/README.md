Simple iambic keyer
19 Nov 2018 {
   Added PTT line triggerd once paddle is pressed and delayed once paddle is not pressed}
 TODO : Trigger PTT once paddle is pressed but characters being sent with a small delay in order to allow transceiver to fully
        switch on transmit before any key is sent. (aka 1 sign bufer)
